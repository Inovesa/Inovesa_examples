# Examples for Inovesa

This repository contains example configurations and scripts to be used with
[Inovesa](https://zenodo.org/record/1181722).


## KARA
Examples modeling the *KArlsruhe Research Accelerator*.
They are typically named after a measurement shift where the  real accelerator was operated with the settings also used in the simulation.


### f05135 (Spectrogram)
Comparable to measurements of KARA operation shift *f05135*.
Goal of the simulation is to reproduce a *bursting spectrogram* similar to the one that was used as an exmple in [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 030704](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.20.030704).
