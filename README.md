# Examples for Inovesa

This repository contains example configurations and scripts to be used with
[Inovesa](https://zenodo.org/record/1181722).


## KARA
Examples modeling the *KArlsruhe Research Accelerator*.
They are typically named after a measurement shift where the  real accelerator was operated with the settings also used in the simulation.


### f05135 (Spectrogram)
Comparable to measurements of KARA operation shift *f05135*.
Goal of the simulation is to reproduce a *bursting spectrogram* similar to the one that was used as an exmple in [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 030704](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.20.030704).


### f05493 (Phase Shift)
Comparable to measurements of KARA operation shift *f05493*.
Goal of the simulation is to show a big difference between the *average phase* (center of mass of the bunch) and the *synchronous phase* defined using a individual particle.
Some results are used on the poster of the poster shown at the IPAC'18 (WEPAL028).

### f06112 (Phase Shift)
Comparable to measurements of KARA operation shift *f06112*.
Goal of the simulation is to determine the *synchronous phase shift* (here defined by the average phase) due to the CSR impedance.
The results can be seen in the proceedings of [IPAC'18,  WEPAL028](https://doi.org/10.18429/JACoW-IPAC2018-WEPAL028).


### f06214 (Noise, Passive Particle Tracking)
Comparable to measurements of KARA operation shift *f06214*.
This simulation serves as example for several new features of *Inovesa v1.1*.
Explanation can be found in [IOP 1067, 062025](https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1067/6/062025).
