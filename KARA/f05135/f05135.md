## About

The scripts contained in this directory produce data comparable to the dataset used in [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 20, 030704](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.20.030704).
When you have Inovesa installed, you can directly run

    ./f05135_iso.sh

If Inovesa is not installed you have to define the path inside the script.
The spectrogram plot is created by running

    ./plot_f05135_spectrogram.sh
